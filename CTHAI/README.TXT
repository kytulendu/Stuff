A library that enable DOS to display and input Thai language in VGA
by Computer Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.

You will need Turbo C and Turbo Assembler or OpenWatcom Assembler
to compile this code.

Currently I have change the coding style to at last make it more easy to read
than original source code and make it compilable, also with single sample
code to test the library, if I have times, I may restructure it for easier
to under stand what the code do.

The font is the same format used by THAI-WRITER/CU-WRITER and the .LGO file,
I guess it is 16 color raw VGA image of sort.

Also I have add the original source code for people who just want to look at it.
